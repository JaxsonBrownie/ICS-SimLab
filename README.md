# ICS-SimLab

![logo](docs/logo.png)

**Second development of the ICS simulation program. Designed to simulate general ICS and SCADA systems through a configurable system**

The project is still under development. 
<br>
In it's current state, it is able to simulate Industrial Control Systems of low complexity. 

- Refer to [init.md](docs/init.md) to start a preconfigured simulation.
- Refer to [architecture.md](https://googe.com) to understand the architecture of the simulation.
- Refer to [configure.md](docs/configure.md) to learn to configure a custom SCADA simulation.
